  Upload your coverage reports to Codecov without dealing with complex
  configurations. This orb helps you get coverage results quickly so that you
  can breathe easier and commit your code with confidence.

  If running on `alpine` builds, the orb will need `coreutils`, `curl`, and
  `gnupg` in order to validate.
